For better deblurring, we need narrower PSF(point spread function) which can result in very low
values at lower frequencies.

In the algo, if PSF goes below threshgold value, we dont change the fourier trasform of blurred 
photo. After several iterations of deblurring, the PSF will be so narrow that all frequencie le-
ss than threshold frequency(which corresponds to highest data that can be stored at that resolu
tion) will have very low coefficients.

So image will not change on further iterations.So deblurring can be thought to be limited by re-
solution of image.

Also information loss happens due to gaussian blur which kills some fourier components so much 
that we can't divide to retrieve them anymore.
