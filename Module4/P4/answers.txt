For the data which varies faster, the lower frequency fourier approximation works best,
as it helps to smoothen the data by loss of High frequency data i.e. noise.

But when it comes to slow varying data, low frequency approximation leads to loss of data
itself which leads to wiggles and artifacts. 

So in square wave, high frequency terms have 
information for discontinuity and flat top so this information is lost when we do low frequency approximation.
