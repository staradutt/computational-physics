For the advection case, when we implement Lax wendroff with viscosity, the oscillations reduce.

For burgers case, when we implement Lax-Wendroff with viscosity with qcon=~0.923 we get good stability but
minor fluctuations still remain near the peaks.

Also it is noticed, that the upwind scheme fails once the shockwave forms at around t=0.1.
