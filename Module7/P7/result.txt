The function for calculating total enegy is included in the program. It is named totalenergy. It takes the state as argument and 
returns the energy.

From various runs it is seen that,
	A decrease in magnetisation is observed from T=1 to T=2 at equilibrium. At T=3, the magnetisation is approximately 0 fluctuating
	with some random noise. This is also seen in the final equilibrium snapshots where :
		for T=1 almost all(~100%) lattice points have the same spin
		for T=2 majority(~95%) of lattice points have same spin while rest (5%) have opposie spin.
		for T=3 it is almost random ie 50:50 up & down 

It can be safely guessed that the critical temperature for phase transition is somewhere between T=2 and T=3.



#note
The sign of magnetisation is random, we get positive magnetisation for half the time and negative for other half.
So the sign of magnetisation is arbitrary. The Ising model has no preference for up/down spins in absence of any magnetic field.
