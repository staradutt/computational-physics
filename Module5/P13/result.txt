from the graph the value of initial θ for which ξ=2, should lie between 3 and 4.

Newton Raphson iterations:

iteration    value of θ initial
0           1.5
1           2.36267
2           3.12517
3           3.41802
4           3.44469


So value of θ initial for which ξ=2, is calculated by newton raphson to be 3.44469
