The plot shows the dynamics of equilibrium. 
The fox population comes down as the number of rabbit population reduce due to unavailability of food.
As the fox population comes down, the rabbit population grows due to less hunting.
As the rabbit population grows, it means abundant food suppy for fox and they grow in number leading to decrese in rabbit population.
And the cycle continues.
