For the case where h is small i.e. 0.5*Δtstab, both explicit forward euler and implicit backward euler
give the same result.
This result matches with analytical result which is also plotted.

But when h is large i.e. 10*Δtsta, explicit euler blows up as expected. But the implicit one also blows
up. 

This is because of stiff ODE. We need higher order implicit method.
