part A

Desired input revolution time for satellite in s = 86400.0
Calculated altitude in km= 35862.60582795607

part B

Altitude of satellite that orbit earth once every day: 35862.60582795607 km
Altitude of satellite that orbit earth once every 90 min: 274.3943043823624 km
Altitude of satellite that orbit earth once every 45 min: -2187.291195801455 km

As altitude cannot be negative,it suggests that there is a minimum time period at which altitude is zero.
The satellite grazes the surface of earth in that case.

part C

Altitude of geosynchronous satellite:35780.43114374147km
The earth takes 23hrs56min i.e.23.93hrs to complete a rotation,but between two sunrise in a given place on earth 
the time is 24hr. This is because of revolution of earth for which it needs to rotate 4 more minutes to catch up with the sun.
Altitude difference: 82.17468421459198km
