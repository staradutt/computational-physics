solution of 0.001(x^2)+1000x+0.001 by first method is :[-9.999894245993346e-07, -999999.999999].
solution of 0.001(x^2)+1000x+0.001 by second method is :[-1.000000000001e-06, -1000010.5755125057]

When we subtract two closeby numbers we generate errors if the difference is close to
to machine precision. So the correct way is to select one root from each method so that the problem is avoided.

solution of 0.001(x^2)+1000x+0.001 by correct method is :[-1.000000000001e-06, -999999.999999]
