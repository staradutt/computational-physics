A collection of Python programs for solving physics problems!
In this repository, you will find a variety of programs that demonstrate 
how to use Python to solve a range of physics problems,from classical 
mechanics to quantum mechanics and beyond. 

Most of these are taken from the homework assignments of the 
computational physics course taught by professor Manish Jain at IISc.

Organisation:
In each module there is a document containing the list of problems. Each problem is a programming assignment
and the solution to each problem is contained in the subfolders.

Module 1 is about:
Python basics, machine representation, precision and errors, power series, 
numerical expressions, polynomial equations, plotting functions etc. 

Module 2 is about: 
Quadrature methods, Newton-Cotes formulae for approximating integrals, 
Romberg-Extrapolation, Gaussian quadrature, adaptive step size

Module 3 is about:
Finding roots of single valued functions: iterative approaches, 
Close domain methods like bisection and False position, Open domain methods like
Newton Raphson method, Secant method, Mullers method, roots of polynomials and
non linear equations

Module 4 is about:
Fast fourier transform, convolution, correlation, power spectrums

Module 5 is about:
Ordinary differential equations
Initial value problems: First order Euler method, Second order single point method, Runge-Kutta methods
Multi-point methods, Leapfrog method, Verlet method
Boundary value problems: Shooting method, equilibrium boundary method/ finite difference method

Module 6 is about:
Solving differential equations using Matrix factorizations (QR, Gram-schmidt, Householder, LU 
and cholesky, Schur's method ), Tri-diagonalsystems, Jacobi iteration, conjugate gradients, 
Eigen value problems

Module 7 is about:
Generating random numbers, Monte-Carlo integration, Random Walk, Metropolis algorithm
